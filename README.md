# better-t-ins

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MySQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses MySQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MySQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
bun db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## HTTPS

To enable HTTPS, you need to install mkcert and generate a self-signed certificate and key using the following command:

```bash
./generate-certs.sh
```

Also, to run the server with HTTPS, you need to run Caddy on the host machine with the following command:

```bash
caddy run --config Caddyfile
```
